1
00:00:00,043 --> 00:00:06,273
'You snap the band on your wrist when
your thoughts and feelings overwhelm you.'

2
00:00:06,323 --> 00:00:09,173
I'm sorry, I want to remember, I really do.

3
00:00:09,223 --> 00:00:11,693
- I know everything!
- What are you talking about?

4
00:00:11,743 --> 00:00:14,373
Paul confessed, Katie. There's
no need to cover for him.

5
00:00:14,423 --> 00:00:16,973
'You need to get your stories
straight. According to her,

6
00:00:17,023 --> 00:00:19,973
'there's been no affair, just,
just some kind of sexual assault.'

7
00:00:20,023 --> 00:00:22,253
Jesus, Paul, what did you do to her?

8
00:00:22,303 --> 00:00:24,653
When I met Peter, I
already had a boyfriend.

9
00:00:24,703 --> 00:00:27,533
That boyfriend was Tom,
who became my husband.

10
00:00:27,583 --> 00:00:29,853
- 'And you never told him what happened?'
- 'No.'

11
00:00:29,903 --> 00:00:31,053
Who are you?

12
00:00:31,103 --> 00:00:33,733
Excuse me, ma'am. The divers
might have found something.

13
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:35,693
Where's Mummy sleeping?

14
00:00:35,743 --> 00:00:37,613
In there.

15
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:39,093
In his own mind,

16
00:00:39,143 --> 00:00:43,813
he believes he has the right to
decide who lives and who dies.

17
00:00:43,863 --> 00:00:45,103
Peter?

18
00:01:46,903 --> 00:01:48,143
Stella?

19
00:02:14,223 --> 00:02:17,053
Help me. I don't want to die.

20
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,023
Stop shaking.

21
00:03:43,663 --> 00:03:46,303
- Start again, steady hand.
- Mmm.

22
00:03:54,863 --> 00:03:56,983
- Is this your phone?
- Yeah.

23
00:05:53,383 --> 00:05:54,943
The child locks are on.

24
00:05:57,263 --> 00:05:59,463
I don't understand what's happening.

25
00:06:02,303 --> 00:06:04,143
- What are you doing?
- Stay still.

26
00:06:47,423 --> 00:06:48,983
Where are you taking me?

27
00:06:51,863 --> 00:06:53,263
Are my babies all right?

28
00:06:54,543 --> 00:06:55,583
Yes.

29
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:58,023
And Tom?

30
00:06:59,663 --> 00:07:02,293
You mean the drunk sleeping on the sofa?

31
00:07:02,343 --> 00:07:03,663
He's dead to the world.

32
00:07:07,823 --> 00:07:09,423
Why are you doing this to me?

33
00:07:21,383 --> 00:07:22,663
What is this?

34
00:07:23,663 --> 00:07:25,343
You went to the police, Rose.

35
00:07:26,503 --> 00:07:27,863
I didn't.

36
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:32,933
You sat with a police
officer, probably for hours,

37
00:07:32,983 --> 00:07:35,973
and put together that likeness of me.

38
00:07:36,023 --> 00:07:37,903
This doesn't even look like you.

39
00:07:40,823 --> 00:07:42,903
You've made my life very difficult.

40
00:07:50,143 --> 00:07:52,983
But... you're not... him.

41
00:07:55,303 --> 00:07:56,503
Are you?

42
00:08:05,743 --> 00:08:07,373
No.

43
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:09,133
I'm not him.

44
00:08:09,183 --> 00:08:11,733
Well, then you have nothing to fear.

45
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:13,663
Please take me home. Please!

46
00:08:17,903 --> 00:08:19,773
It wasn't me!

47
00:08:19,823 --> 00:08:23,613
Perhaps it was that other
girl, the, the one who survived?

48
00:08:23,663 --> 00:08:26,303
The caption said it was
nine years ago. It was you.

49
00:08:27,343 --> 00:08:29,183
No, it wasn't me.

50
00:08:33,303 --> 00:08:35,453
The thought that you could be him,

51
00:08:35,503 --> 00:08:36,943
that you could be the man.

52
00:08:38,103 --> 00:08:39,623
It never crossed my mind.

53
00:08:42,303 --> 00:08:44,903
Have you forgotten what
happened between us?

54
00:08:46,023 --> 00:08:47,733
No.

55
00:08:47,783 --> 00:08:49,743
No, I hadn't forgotten.

56
00:08:52,143 --> 00:08:53,583
But that doesn't mean...

57
00:08:56,543 --> 00:08:58,773
We were just trying things...

58
00:08:58,823 --> 00:09:00,973
doing things.

59
00:09:01,023 --> 00:09:02,863
It was just something that happened.

60
00:09:04,463 --> 00:09:05,943
Too much to drink.

61
00:09:07,223 --> 00:09:09,023
It was a lifetime ago.

62
00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:19,623
I'm married. I'm a mother now.

63
00:09:21,703 --> 00:09:24,653
Maybe it was some other girl, some
other girl that you were seeing!

64
00:09:24,703 --> 00:09:26,303
There was no other girl.

65
00:09:28,143 --> 00:09:29,503
You were the only girl.

66
00:09:31,943 --> 00:09:33,423
And you've betrayed me.

67
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:26,423
Ah! No! No!

68
00:10:42,503 --> 00:10:45,013
No! No!

69
00:11:01,383 --> 00:11:03,303
Ah, no!

70
00:11:09,743 --> 00:11:11,463
Nancy!

71
00:11:22,263 --> 00:11:25,223
- Time for breakfast.
- I'm coming, Daddy.

72
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:36,543
Nancy!

73
00:11:39,663 --> 00:11:41,133
What are they doing?

74
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,903
Looking for him, stupid.

75
00:11:44,063 --> 00:11:45,293
What?!

76
00:11:45,343 --> 00:11:47,133
They must think he lives round here.

77
00:11:47,183 --> 00:11:49,533
Oh, my God. Seriously?

78
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,063
That's the last time I'm
sleeping over at yours.

79
00:12:23,783 --> 00:12:28,893
Right-handed professional
decorating shears.

80
00:12:28,943 --> 00:12:32,333
29 centimetre overall length.

81
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:36,973
17.5 centimetre cutting
blade... just under seven inches.

82
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:38,813
How long were they in the water?

83
00:12:38,863 --> 00:12:41,423
I'm assuming since the night of the 20th.

84
00:12:43,743 --> 00:12:46,653
We can examine them for
trace and contact evidence...

85
00:12:46,703 --> 00:12:48,973
blood, fingerprints, fibres...

86
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:52,493
but it will be degraded after
that amount of time underwater.

87
00:12:52,543 --> 00:12:54,343
They were quite deep in the silt.

88
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:59,743
Start with the fingerprints and then
see if anything else can be gleaned.

89
00:13:01,223 --> 00:13:02,743
We need to fast-track them.

90
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:44,333
Where did you put Rose?

91
00:13:44,383 --> 00:13:46,103
Er, she's not here yet, ma'am.

92
00:13:47,823 --> 00:13:50,533
I have her mobile number. Will
you call her place of work?

93
00:14:34,343 --> 00:14:36,613
'You have one new message.'

94
00:14:36,663 --> 00:14:40,093
'Rose, this is Detective
Superintendent Gibson.

95
00:14:40,143 --> 00:14:41,453
We were due to meet today.

96
00:14:41,503 --> 00:14:43,933
Please ring and let me
know when you'll be here.

97
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:46,533
I do have further questions for you.

98
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:50,023
It's essential that you come
in today. Please call me.'

99
00:14:54,663 --> 00:14:57,133
Her first appointment at work
was at eight this morning.

100
00:14:57,183 --> 00:14:59,253
She didn't turn up and
no word from her either.

101
00:14:59,303 --> 00:15:02,213
Several patients have not received
their radiology treatments.

102
00:15:02,263 --> 00:15:04,933
Her department at the hospital
have been trying to reach her.

103
00:15:04,983 --> 00:15:07,943
This has never happened
before. No reply from home.

104
00:15:09,943 --> 00:15:13,743
See if the hospital human resources
has a next-of-kin number for Rose.

105
00:15:16,943 --> 00:15:19,093
'When was the last time that you saw her?'

106
00:15:19,143 --> 00:15:21,893
Erm, she left in the
early hours of the morning.

107
00:15:21,943 --> 00:15:23,613
'What time?'

108
00:15:23,663 --> 00:15:26,063
Um, I'm not sure. I was sleeping.

109
00:15:27,143 --> 00:15:28,573
So how do you know?

110
00:15:28,623 --> 00:15:30,103
'Um, she left me a note.'

111
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:33,093
Do you still have that note?

112
00:15:33,143 --> 00:15:34,813
Yeah.

113
00:15:34,863 --> 00:15:36,973
'Please keep it safe.'

114
00:15:37,023 --> 00:15:38,743
Why? What's this about?

115
00:15:40,183 --> 00:15:41,973
'Where are you, Tom?'

116
00:15:42,023 --> 00:15:43,933
I'm in the park.

117
00:15:43,983 --> 00:15:47,903
'Go home. Meet me there. I'm on my way.'

118
00:17:11,183 --> 00:17:13,653
Are you aware that Rose
was due to see me today?

119
00:17:13,703 --> 00:17:14,943
Yes. I am.

120
00:17:16,023 --> 00:17:17,893
And do you know why?

121
00:17:17,943 --> 00:17:19,263
I think so.

122
00:17:22,623 --> 00:17:24,733
How does she normally get to work?

123
00:17:24,783 --> 00:17:25,983
She drives.

124
00:17:27,103 --> 00:17:28,493
And her car is gone?

125
00:17:28,543 --> 00:17:29,583
Yes.

126
00:17:32,103 --> 00:17:35,663
Anything strike you as
unusual this morning, Tom?

127
00:17:36,983 --> 00:17:39,813
Er, maybe, one thing.
I'm sure it's nothing.

128
00:17:39,863 --> 00:17:41,333
Go on.

129
00:17:41,383 --> 00:17:44,653
Her bite guard was over there, on the side.

130
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,853
Her?

131
00:17:45,903 --> 00:17:49,933
Bite guard. She wears it at night
to stop her from grinding her teeth.

132
00:17:49,983 --> 00:17:52,613
Normally, when she wakes,
she puts it in its wee box

133
00:17:52,663 --> 00:17:54,773
at the side of bed and...

134
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:57,263
at night, she rinses
it and puts it back in.

135
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:01,733
And this is her handwriting?

136
00:18:01,783 --> 00:18:04,413
- Yes.
- Her normal hand?

137
00:18:04,463 --> 00:18:07,143
Yes. Should I be worried?

138
00:18:08,263 --> 00:18:10,253
Why are you here?

139
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:13,503
Just to look after you while
your daddy answers some questions.

140
00:18:16,383 --> 00:18:17,823
Look what I found.

141
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:25,023
It's sad, isn't it?

142
00:18:26,183 --> 00:18:27,743
It's very sad.

143
00:18:33,143 --> 00:18:35,013
You weren't aware

144
00:18:35,063 --> 00:18:36,543
of her getting out of bed?

145
00:18:37,543 --> 00:18:39,023
I wasn't in bed with her.

146
00:18:40,463 --> 00:18:41,783
Where were you?

147
00:18:42,823 --> 00:18:44,383
I slept on the sofa.

148
00:18:46,103 --> 00:18:47,383
Why?

149
00:18:48,423 --> 00:18:49,623
We'd argued.

150
00:18:50,783 --> 00:18:52,063
What about?

151
00:18:54,863 --> 00:18:57,973
She told me she was coming in to see you,

152
00:18:58,023 --> 00:19:02,783
that she had already spoken to you
once before, and she told me why.

153
00:19:03,983 --> 00:19:08,503
And what she told me explained
something that has always...

154
00:19:10,263 --> 00:19:12,573
That I'd never understood before.

155
00:19:12,623 --> 00:19:14,103
What was that?

156
00:19:15,463 --> 00:19:19,493
A period at university when, suddenly,

157
00:19:19,543 --> 00:19:21,493
she wouldn't talk to me,

158
00:19:21,543 --> 00:19:23,983
see me at all, for three months.

159
00:19:25,383 --> 00:19:29,533
Then, one day, she called. We
started seeing each other again.

160
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:31,543
And we got married soon after.

161
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:36,223
How did you feel...

162
00:19:37,463 --> 00:19:39,543
... when she told you why she'd withdrawn?

163
00:19:40,743 --> 00:19:42,503
Upset.

164
00:19:44,223 --> 00:19:45,733
Angry.

165
00:19:45,783 --> 00:19:47,053
Violently angry?

166
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:48,983
No. No, never.

167
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,773
Angry enough to make her leave you?

168
00:19:52,823 --> 00:19:54,183
No.

169
00:19:57,463 --> 00:19:59,263
I don't, I don't think so.

170
00:20:10,103 --> 00:20:12,453
- Can I help you?
- I'm Paul Spector.

171
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:15,543
Oh, yes, I've been
expecting you. Take a seat.

172
00:20:25,063 --> 00:20:27,143
This is the case file you need.

173
00:20:42,023 --> 00:20:45,543
We're going to need a number
of recent photographs of Rose.

174
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,463
There's quite a lot to choose from.

175
00:20:53,503 --> 00:20:55,103
When was that taken?

176
00:20:56,103 --> 00:20:57,343
That was last year.

177
00:20:58,343 --> 00:21:00,093
That was just last week.

178
00:21:00,143 --> 00:21:02,423
Come in.

179
00:21:04,503 --> 00:21:07,943
- Assistant Chief Constable Burns is here, ma'am.
- Right.

180
00:21:09,943 --> 00:21:11,813
Stay here, Tom.

181
00:21:11,863 --> 00:21:13,383
I'll be back.

182
00:21:21,983 --> 00:21:25,453
Contact Control by radio.
This is Rose Stagg's car.

183
00:21:25,503 --> 00:21:27,343
Circulate the details.

184
00:21:40,263 --> 00:21:42,573
We need to get the
family out of there, Jim.

185
00:21:42,623 --> 00:21:46,053
Conduct an initial visual
search. Open all doors,

186
00:21:46,103 --> 00:21:48,293
access all rooms, cupboards, voids.

187
00:21:48,343 --> 00:21:50,453
She might still be in there somewhere.

188
00:21:50,503 --> 00:21:52,783
Stella, you shouldn't be here.

189
00:21:54,463 --> 00:21:56,973
This isn't a voluntary missing person.

190
00:21:57,023 --> 00:21:58,213
How do you know?

191
00:21:58,263 --> 00:22:00,213
It's an abduction.

192
00:22:00,263 --> 00:22:02,693
The house is a crime scene.

193
00:22:02,743 --> 00:22:06,933
If Peter Piper picked a
peck of pickled peppers,

194
00:22:06,983 --> 00:22:10,503
where's the peck of pickled
peppers Peter Piper picked?

195
00:22:11,503 --> 00:22:13,133
That's the best so far.

196
00:22:13,183 --> 00:22:14,693
Did you learn that at school?

197
00:22:14,743 --> 00:22:17,423
- No, from Peter Piper.
- Really?

198
00:22:18,423 --> 00:22:19,893
Mummy's friend.

199
00:22:19,943 --> 00:22:22,133
Your mummy has a friend called Peter Piper?

200
00:22:22,183 --> 00:22:24,143
Yes. He was here last night.

201
00:22:27,383 --> 00:22:31,413
We made a decision to say that the
likeness was from nine years ago,

202
00:22:31,463 --> 00:22:33,813
and I think we have led
him straight to Rose.

203
00:22:33,863 --> 00:22:35,303
- How?
- Oh...

204
00:22:36,543 --> 00:22:38,173
... and I called him Peter, too.

205
00:22:38,223 --> 00:22:39,783
A common enough name.

206
00:22:41,063 --> 00:22:44,013
Why would we be interested in
a likeness from nine years ago?

207
00:22:44,063 --> 00:22:46,093
Because of a precursor crime.

208
00:22:46,143 --> 00:22:49,533
Something that happened in
the past that seems to presage

209
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:51,253
the current crimes.

210
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:54,583
Like a woman being strangled into
unconsciousness by her boyfriend.

211
00:22:55,783 --> 00:22:58,333
I mean, maybe he did that
with every woman that he met.

212
00:22:58,383 --> 00:23:00,213
But what if he only did it once?

213
00:23:00,263 --> 00:23:03,173
How difficult would that
be for him to work out?

214
00:23:03,223 --> 00:23:05,053
Rose never reported it.

215
00:23:05,103 --> 00:23:08,733
The boyfriend was never
interviewed, charged.

216
00:23:08,783 --> 00:23:11,653
As far as he knows, it's always
remained a private matter.

217
00:23:11,703 --> 00:23:14,253
Until now.

218
00:23:14,303 --> 00:23:16,663
We have made it public.

219
00:23:19,583 --> 00:23:22,493
We should've age-enhanced the
picture and used that instead.

220
00:23:22,543 --> 00:23:24,983
- There's been a development, ma'am.
- Get in.

221
00:23:30,143 --> 00:23:32,333
It's from the daughter, from Nancy.

222
00:23:32,383 --> 00:23:35,693
- Go on.
- It seems there was someone in the house last night.

223
00:23:35,743 --> 00:23:37,973
Someone who said he was
a friend of her mother's.

224
00:23:38,023 --> 00:23:40,973
Nancy watched them going off,
crossing the street together.

225
00:23:41,023 --> 00:23:43,383
Someone who said he was called Peter.

226
00:23:56,863 --> 00:23:58,063
Can I help you?

227
00:23:59,423 --> 00:24:01,863
I'm here to see a patient, Annie Brawley.

228
00:24:34,583 --> 00:24:36,173
Why is he here?

229
00:24:36,223 --> 00:24:38,143
I'm giving the case to Eastwood.

230
00:24:39,303 --> 00:24:40,813
When did you decide that?

231
00:24:40,863 --> 00:24:43,853
If the Task Force investigates
this, the media will be all over it.

232
00:24:43,903 --> 00:24:45,493
We don't need that extra pressure.

233
00:24:45,543 --> 00:24:47,133
I'm sorry, that's ridiculous.

234
00:24:47,183 --> 00:24:49,373
She's been missing for less than 12 hours.

235
00:24:49,423 --> 00:24:51,693
It's important we appear
not to be overreacting.

236
00:24:51,743 --> 00:24:54,533
- Jim!
- You can't see past the killer.

237
00:24:54,583 --> 00:24:58,413
I want all lines of inquiry looked
at... marital, extra-marital,

238
00:24:58,463 --> 00:25:00,213
depression, suicide.

239
00:25:00,263 --> 00:25:03,013
The child said that there was a
stranger in the house last night,

240
00:25:03,063 --> 00:25:04,653
a stranger who called himself Peter.

241
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:07,383
Rose's life is at risk and it's my fault!

242
00:25:09,423 --> 00:25:12,223
I will ask Eastwood to keep
you briefed on any developments.

243
00:25:13,223 --> 00:25:15,293
Gibson.

244
00:25:15,343 --> 00:25:17,973
'Ma'am, it's Larkin. We've
found a receipt for the shears

245
00:25:18,023 --> 00:25:21,333
amongst Annie's papers. I've
obtained a duplicate set.'

246
00:25:21,383 --> 00:25:23,183
I'll meet you at the mortuary.

247
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:28,213
I've read the case notes
and I know the background.

248
00:25:28,263 --> 00:25:32,373
And, in truth, a female therapist
would've been a better option.

249
00:25:32,423 --> 00:25:34,733
I don't believe one was available

250
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:37,463
and, honestly, there's no-one
better qualified than me.

251
00:25:38,743 --> 00:25:41,613
Now, it's possible that your
daughter may react unfavourably

252
00:25:41,663 --> 00:25:42,973
to my presence.

253
00:25:43,023 --> 00:25:45,293
A male of a certain age...

254
00:25:45,343 --> 00:25:47,733
It could trigger an emotional reaction.

255
00:25:47,783 --> 00:25:50,583
So if you would stay close
by, at first at least.

256
00:26:08,983 --> 00:26:10,853
Annie?

257
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:12,293
Yes?

258
00:26:12,343 --> 00:26:13,783
I'm Paul Spector.

259
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:16,143
Can I come in?

260
00:26:18,383 --> 00:26:19,983
Course.

261
00:26:37,623 --> 00:26:39,143
I'll be a minute.

262
00:26:42,063 --> 00:26:43,703
I feel so guilty.

263
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:46,023
Tell me why.

264
00:26:48,263 --> 00:26:50,143
It's not just guilt.

265
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:52,743
It's shame.

266
00:26:54,143 --> 00:26:56,663
What have you got to be ashamed of?

267
00:27:00,303 --> 00:27:02,223
I subscribed to a website.

268
00:27:04,703 --> 00:27:06,303
I created a profile.

269
00:27:07,823 --> 00:27:09,343
What sort of website?

270
00:27:12,383 --> 00:27:14,063
An adult website.

271
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:18,943
I just keep thinking, you know...

272
00:27:20,183 --> 00:27:22,263
... what if he saw me on there? What if...

273
00:27:23,663 --> 00:27:26,343
And what if he chose
me because of that site?

274
00:27:27,983 --> 00:27:29,863
Did you post pictures of yourself?

275
00:27:32,823 --> 00:27:34,263
A couple.

276
00:27:36,783 --> 00:27:38,303
But nothing very revealing.

277
00:27:40,583 --> 00:27:42,063
OK.

278
00:27:45,303 --> 00:27:46,983
But also, erm...

279
00:27:49,303 --> 00:27:50,743
... a video.

280
00:27:51,863 --> 00:27:53,303
What kind of video?

281
00:27:55,223 --> 00:27:56,703
Suggesting...

282
00:27:58,863 --> 00:28:01,823
... suggesting that I
might be up for bondage.

283
00:28:04,103 --> 00:28:05,983
Domination, that type of thing.

284
00:28:08,463 --> 00:28:10,613
I said I had a high...

285
00:28:10,663 --> 00:28:12,773
high threshold for pain.

286
00:28:12,823 --> 00:28:14,503
I actually said that, but...

287
00:28:17,023 --> 00:28:18,783
I didn't know. It was just...

288
00:28:20,783 --> 00:28:25,023
It was just... a fantasy, a... a game.

289
00:28:28,703 --> 00:28:31,213
There's a world of difference, Annie,

290
00:28:31,263 --> 00:28:35,253
between what consenting adults
choose to do in their bedroom

291
00:28:35,303 --> 00:28:37,903
and the violent sexual
assault that you suffered.

292
00:28:39,063 --> 00:28:43,013
Nothing you did, frankly,
nothing you could ever do,

293
00:28:43,063 --> 00:28:46,143
would ever make you responsible
for the events of that night.

294
00:28:48,383 --> 00:28:49,863
That's down to him...

295
00:28:50,903 --> 00:28:52,143
... and him alone.

296
00:28:55,583 --> 00:28:57,733
When did you last see Rose?

297
00:28:57,783 --> 00:29:01,943
I bumped into her at the
market on Sunday. We had coffee.

298
00:29:06,183 --> 00:29:08,903
Is it out of character...

299
00:29:10,023 --> 00:29:11,343
... for her to take off?

300
00:29:14,183 --> 00:29:17,503
You think that's what
happened? She just took off?

301
00:29:18,543 --> 00:29:20,023
Mm. Possible.

302
00:29:22,183 --> 00:29:25,053
It's also possible that
this could all be our fault.

303
00:29:25,103 --> 00:29:27,453
Why do you say that?

304
00:29:27,503 --> 00:29:30,493
Hasn't it occurred to you
that she might have been taken,

305
00:29:30,543 --> 00:29:31,703
by him?

306
00:29:33,343 --> 00:29:35,253
Why would he do that?

307
00:29:35,303 --> 00:29:37,223
I don't know... to silence her?

308
00:29:40,023 --> 00:29:42,933
What if we've exposed her to
danger from that man by getting her

309
00:29:42,983 --> 00:29:44,703
to talk to you about the past?

310
00:29:49,383 --> 00:29:51,263
'Are you keeping a journal?'

311
00:29:54,383 --> 00:29:56,223
It's my diary from before.

312
00:29:59,903 --> 00:30:02,333
The idea is it's supposed to help me

313
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:04,463
remember more about what happened to me.

314
00:30:05,783 --> 00:30:07,143
And has it helped?

315
00:30:11,503 --> 00:30:13,103
I've not read it yet.

316
00:30:17,383 --> 00:30:19,223
Well, maybe it will help.

317
00:30:21,063 --> 00:30:22,463
Or maybe it won't.

318
00:30:24,343 --> 00:30:27,773
We all know people who
live too much in the past.

319
00:30:27,823 --> 00:30:31,093
Too much history, too much remembering,

320
00:30:31,143 --> 00:30:33,023
can ultimately destroy the present...

321
00:30:34,143 --> 00:30:35,823
... and the future.

322
00:30:38,383 --> 00:30:39,743
Thanks.

323
00:30:40,743 --> 00:30:42,143
It's been really useful.

324
00:30:43,143 --> 00:30:44,503
Good.

325
00:30:51,023 --> 00:30:52,893
It's getting too long.

326
00:30:52,943 --> 00:30:54,503
It's annoying me.

327
00:30:56,063 --> 00:30:57,863
Use that hairband to put it back.

328
00:31:00,143 --> 00:31:01,983
This is for something else.

329
00:31:03,583 --> 00:31:05,423
A friend gave it to me.

330
00:31:06,463 --> 00:31:07,703
A friend?

331
00:31:09,583 --> 00:31:10,863
Yeah.

332
00:31:13,583 --> 00:31:16,653
I can arrange for a hairdresser
to visit if you like?

333
00:31:16,703 --> 00:31:19,493
- Really?
- Of course.

334
00:31:23,383 --> 00:31:24,903
Well, then...

335
00:31:25,903 --> 00:31:28,103
... yes, please.

336
00:31:29,183 --> 00:31:31,263
I'll see you the day after tomorrow.

337
00:31:52,943 --> 00:31:55,853
'You have one new message.'

338
00:31:55,903 --> 00:31:58,493
'I'm at the school gates
to pick up Liam and Olivia,

339
00:31:58,543 --> 00:32:00,493
but Olivia isn't here.

340
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:01,983
Why is your phone always... '

341
00:32:07,343 --> 00:32:09,293
- 'Hello?'
- Sally, it's me. What's going on?

342
00:32:09,343 --> 00:32:10,893
'I'm calling the police.'

343
00:32:10,943 --> 00:32:13,013
- Why?
- 'Olivia's been taken.'

344
00:32:13,063 --> 00:32:14,293
What do you mean "taken"?

345
00:32:14,343 --> 00:32:17,173
'Your fucking little
tramp of a girlfriend.'

346
00:32:17,223 --> 00:32:18,773
- What?
- 'Katie.'

347
00:32:18,823 --> 00:32:21,333
'She told Miss Selmer that
I asked her to pick up Livvy.

348
00:32:21,383 --> 00:32:23,933
Pick up Livvy and leave
Liam to wait for me?!'

349
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:28,013
- 'I'm calling the police.'
- Don't do that. I'll deal with it.

350
00:32:28,063 --> 00:32:30,813
'How the hell can you do
that? You're in Scotland.'

351
00:32:30,863 --> 00:32:33,373
Actually I'm not. I'm here, I'm in Belfast.

352
00:32:33,423 --> 00:32:36,373
'What? When did that happen?'

353
00:32:36,423 --> 00:32:39,103
Now. Today. I'm back.

354
00:32:41,263 --> 00:32:43,053
I've got her number.

355
00:32:43,103 --> 00:32:47,063
- 'I bet you have.'
- I'll call her. Just wait.

356
00:33:07,143 --> 00:33:10,053
These are the same size, make and brand

357
00:33:10,103 --> 00:33:12,543
as the pair that we pulled from the water.

358
00:33:16,663 --> 00:33:18,693
The direction of force

359
00:33:18,743 --> 00:33:22,703
is more or less at a
perpendicular angle to the skin.

360
00:33:23,703 --> 00:33:25,333
And here...

361
00:33:25,383 --> 00:33:28,133
we have abrasions that look
like they've been caused

362
00:33:28,183 --> 00:33:29,973
by the handle of the weapon...

363
00:33:30,023 --> 00:33:31,533
a kind of hilt-mark injury.

364
00:33:31,583 --> 00:33:35,373
You said that the maximal depth
of the wounds was nine inches,

365
00:33:35,423 --> 00:33:39,733
but these scissors have blades
that are under seven inches.

366
00:33:39,783 --> 00:33:44,413
Yeah, because of the compression
of the body with force,

367
00:33:44,463 --> 00:33:48,823
the depth measurement can be
greater than the length of the blade.

368
00:33:50,943 --> 00:33:54,423
There's nothing to indicate that
these aren't the murder weapon.

369
00:34:07,783 --> 00:34:09,493
'Have you found them?'

370
00:34:09,543 --> 00:34:10,813
Not yet.

371
00:34:10,863 --> 00:34:12,093
'Paul... '

372
00:34:12,143 --> 00:34:15,623
Wait just a little longer.
I'll call you as soon as I do.

373
00:34:36,143 --> 00:34:38,533
You have a funny name.

374
00:34:38,583 --> 00:34:39,893
Katrina?

375
00:34:39,943 --> 00:34:43,013
No. Like my name is Spector.

376
00:34:43,063 --> 00:34:45,653
Oh, Benedetto.

377
00:34:45,703 --> 00:34:47,493
It's Italian.

378
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:50,213
Did you get teased at school?

379
00:34:50,263 --> 00:34:51,663
A bit.

380
00:34:53,063 --> 00:34:57,663
- Is this it? Is this really your favourite place?
- Yeah.

381
00:35:21,183 --> 00:35:23,413
Do you remember that necklace you had?

382
00:35:23,463 --> 00:35:26,343
- The one with the beetle on it?
- Daddy gave it to me.

383
00:35:27,503 --> 00:35:28,853
Where did he get it?

384
00:35:28,903 --> 00:35:32,143
I don't know. It was a present
for trying hard at school.

385
00:35:33,223 --> 00:35:34,893
Do you still have it?

386
00:35:34,943 --> 00:35:37,293
- I lost it.
- How?

387
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:40,223
- It disappeared.
- When?

388
00:35:42,383 --> 00:35:43,783
I don't know.

389
00:36:02,863 --> 00:36:04,343
Daddy!

390
00:36:06,223 --> 00:36:08,253
Hey.

391
00:36:08,303 --> 00:36:10,663
- When did you get back?
- Today.

392
00:36:11,943 --> 00:36:13,943
It's getting late. We need to get you home.

393
00:36:18,583 --> 00:36:20,303
Wait for me there.

394
00:36:22,823 --> 00:36:25,503
- Say goodbye to Katie.
- Bye, Katie.

395
00:37:03,063 --> 00:37:04,893
Hello.

396
00:37:04,943 --> 00:37:06,453
Straight upstairs, please.

397
00:37:06,503 --> 00:37:08,693
I want to be with Daddy.

398
00:37:08,743 --> 00:37:11,373
It's late. Upstairs and
into your pyjamas now.

399
00:37:11,423 --> 00:37:13,623
- I'm hungry.
- Upstairs.

400
00:37:20,903 --> 00:37:22,533
Where were they?

401
00:37:22,583 --> 00:37:24,133
In the park.

402
00:37:24,183 --> 00:37:25,423
When did you get back?

403
00:37:26,423 --> 00:37:28,253
Just this afternoon.

404
00:37:28,303 --> 00:37:31,293
What is wrong with that girl?
Why does she want to hurt me?

405
00:37:31,343 --> 00:37:34,293
It's not you she wants to hurt, it's me.

406
00:37:34,343 --> 00:37:36,333
Daddy! Are you coming?

407
00:37:36,383 --> 00:37:40,543
The things she said to you,
they're... they're teenage fantasies.

408
00:37:41,703 --> 00:37:45,493
There was no attack, no
near-rape or whatever.

409
00:37:45,543 --> 00:37:49,373
Olivia saw you. She got
out of bed and she saw you.

410
00:37:49,423 --> 00:37:51,293
What did she see?

411
00:37:51,343 --> 00:37:53,103
You and Katie on the floor.

412
00:37:55,023 --> 00:37:58,493
- That was probably one of her dreams.
- Oh, Jesus!

413
00:37:58,543 --> 00:38:01,733
We can ask her about it
together, now or in the morning.

414
00:38:01,783 --> 00:38:03,943
- Talk to her about it.
- Ask her?

415
00:38:05,263 --> 00:38:07,533
You have no idea, do you? Ask her?

416
00:38:07,583 --> 00:38:08,893
Sally...

417
00:38:08,943 --> 00:38:11,413
Anyway, you won't be here in the morning.

418
00:38:11,463 --> 00:38:14,223
I want you gone and out of this house now.

419
00:38:15,903 --> 00:38:17,263
And what will I say to Olivia?

420
00:38:18,263 --> 00:38:19,743
You'll think of something.

421
00:38:36,143 --> 00:38:39,453
- Did you have fun with Katie?
- It was OK.

422
00:38:39,503 --> 00:38:43,053
- What did you talk about?
- School and stuff.

423
00:38:43,103 --> 00:38:46,103
- She likes to ask a lot of questions doesn't she?
- Quite a lot.

424
00:38:47,503 --> 00:38:50,493
- What did she ask you?
- About Scotland.

425
00:38:50,543 --> 00:38:52,253
What else?

426
00:38:52,303 --> 00:38:55,183
My necklace, the one that got lost.

427
00:39:08,383 --> 00:39:11,093
- I have to go, darling.
- Why?

428
00:39:11,143 --> 00:39:12,853
I have things to do.

429
00:39:12,903 --> 00:39:14,823

What?

440
00:40:33,103 --> 00:40:34,943
How can I?

441
00:40:37,263 --> 00:40:38,863
Don't sit down.

442
00:40:46,063 --> 00:40:49,053
What do you mean you can't have the baby?

443
00:40:49,103 --> 00:40:50,493
What do you think I mean?

444
00:40:50,543 --> 00:40:52,493
Sally, you can't do that.

445
00:40:52,543 --> 00:40:55,373
- Why not?
- You're a neo-natal nurse.

446
00:40:55,423 --> 00:40:57,133
We're not Catholic.

447
00:40:57,183 --> 00:40:59,213
My mother was Catholic.

448
00:40:59,263 --> 00:41:04,263
What, the woman that killed
herself? Abandoned you?

449
00:41:11,743 --> 00:41:13,583
The police were here earlier.

450
00:41:14,663 --> 00:41:16,533
What do you mean?

451
00:41:16,583 --> 00:41:20,623
Knocking on all the doors, talking
to all the men in the neighbourhood.

452
00:41:21,703 --> 00:41:23,223
What did you say?

453
00:41:24,303 --> 00:41:26,503
I told them you were in Scotland.

454
00:41:27,823 --> 00:41:29,183
Is that all?

455
00:41:30,703 --> 00:41:33,823
I wanted to tell them
that I'd lied for you.

456
00:41:34,863 --> 00:41:36,223
But you didn't?

457
00:41:39,303 --> 00:41:40,503
I tried.

458
00:41:42,703 --> 00:41:45,413
I tried really hard in Scotland.

459
00:41:45,463 --> 00:41:46,773
I know.

460
00:41:46,823 --> 00:41:49,613
You were cold, distant.

461
00:41:49,663 --> 00:41:53,013
I was ill. I had food
poisoning or something.

462
00:41:53,063 --> 00:41:55,263
You made no effort, Paul.

463
00:42:02,743 --> 00:42:05,503
You held me down on the floor.

464
00:42:08,263 --> 00:42:10,543
"If you were mine".

465
00:42:53,663 --> 00:42:56,773
"This morning, a spokesperson
from the City Hospital said

466
00:42:56,823 --> 00:43:00,613
Mr Monroe, who is in intensive
care, remains in critical condition.

"Mi ritrovai per una selva oscura,

I warned you once before
about fucking up my family.

This is your last warning.

Why?

What are you going to do to me?

00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:10,223
Good. Do it!

484
00:44:12,663 --> 00:44:13,823
Good.

485
00:44:14,823 --> 00:44:16,143
Kill me.

486
00:44:32,783 --> 00:44:34,693
This is all bullshit.

487
00:44:34,743 --> 00:44:37,533
You don't think I'm a killer
at all or you wouldn't be here.

488
00:44:37,583 --> 00:44:38,933
Fuck! You hurt me!

489
00:44:38,983 --> 00:44:41,053
That's nothing compared
to what I'll do to you

490
00:44:41,103 --> 00:44:42,853
if you don't stop playing your games.

491
00:44:42,903 --> 00:44:44,613
I'm not playing games.

492
00:44:44,663 --> 00:44:47,093
Dancing in front of me,
writing songs about me,

493
00:44:47,143 --> 00:44:48,733
stripping on the stairs.

494
00:44:48,783 --> 00:44:52,253
You're playing games.
Stupid, childish games.

495
00:44:52,303 --> 00:44:54,173
Don't call me a child again.

496
00:44:54,223 --> 00:44:55,773
You're 15 years old.

497
00:44:55,823 --> 00:44:58,813
- I'm 16 now.
- Still a child.

498
00:44:58,863 --> 00:45:00,893
I'm not a child!

499
00:45:00,943 --> 00:45:02,463
Don't shout.

500
00:45:03,983 --> 00:45:05,853
You're a liar!

501
00:45:05,903 --> 00:45:08,813
You told me you couldn't
trust yourself around me.

502
00:45:08,863 --> 00:45:10,623
You said I was beautiful.

503
00:45:12,183 --> 00:45:14,183
I was fucking with your head!

504
00:45:16,983 --> 00:45:19,733
You pig. I fucking hate you.

505
00:45:19,783 --> 00:45:22,053
Then stay out of my life.

506
00:45:22,103 --> 00:45:24,733
How can I with all that I know about you?

507
00:45:24,783 --> 00:45:26,493
You know nothing about me.

508
00:45:26,543 --> 00:45:29,653
You're a suburban schoolgirl with
a load of sensational fantasies

509
00:45:29,703 --> 00:45:31,413
running around her head.

510
00:45:31,463 --> 00:45:32,943
I'm much more than that.

511
00:45:34,223 --> 00:45:35,933
No.

512
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:39,503
You're a little virgin
dreaming of her first fuck.

513
00:45:41,383 --> 00:45:42,623
OK.

514
00:45:43,743 --> 00:45:45,583
If that's what you want.

515
00:46:20,423 --> 00:46:22,143
What are you doing?

516
00:46:39,823 --> 00:46:41,223
Paul?

517
00:47:04,223 --> 00:47:06,623
Ah! Get off!

518
00:47:54,823 --> 00:47:56,343
What are you doing?

519
00:48:00,623 --> 00:48:03,173
Consider it a test.

520
00:48:03,223 --> 00:48:04,863
What?

521
00:48:06,743 --> 00:48:10,663
Your bonds aren't tight
and your wrists are small.

522
00:48:11,783 --> 00:48:14,303
You should be able to
get out easily enough.

523
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:17,943
While you struggle...

524
00:48:19,903 --> 00:48:22,583
... why don't you have a think
about what you want to do next.

525
00:48:23,863 --> 00:48:28,463
As Camus says, "Life is the
sum of all your choices."

526
00:48:29,943 --> 00:48:32,103
Choose your next move carefully, Katie.

- Yes?

Recording Officer at the labs.'

00:48:57,783 --> 00:48:58,853
Go ahead.

00:48:58,903 --> 00:49:00,503
'Paul Spector.'

How are you spelling that surname?

536
00:49:05,143 --> 00:49:09,343
'S-P-E-C-T-O-R.'

537
00:49:10,743 --> 00:49:12,103
Spector.

538
00:49:28,223 --> 00:49:29,933
Paul Spector.

539
00:49:29,983 --> 00:49:33,453
Apparently, we talked to him in
connection with the Sarah Kay murder.

540
00:49:33,503 --> 00:49:34,783
Yeah.

541
00:49:38,783 --> 00:49:42,293
Identified himself in the CCTV
footage in the Botanic Gardens.

542
00:49:42,343 --> 00:49:44,453
Came in voluntarily.

543
00:49:44,503 --> 00:49:47,733
- I want every detail on that interview. Was it taped?
- Yes, ma'am.

544
00:49:47,783 --> 00:49:50,263
Find the audio tapes. I want to hear them.

545
00:50:15,743 --> 00:50:18,733
'Where were you last night, Mr Spector?'

546
00:50:18,783 --> 00:50:22,813
'Last night? Why? What
happened last night?'

547
00:50:22,863 --> 00:50:24,583
'Just answer the question.'

548
00:50:26,663 --> 00:50:29,613
'My wife was working
at the Neo-natal Unit.'

549
00:50:29,663 --> 00:50:30,983
'And you?'

550
00:50:32,023 --> 00:50:33,533
'I was with the children.'

551
00:50:33,583 --> 00:50:35,263
'All evening and all night?'

552
00:50:36,743 --> 00:50:40,493
'Fed them, bathed them, put them to bed.'

553
00:50:40,543 --> 00:50:42,143
'I had an early night myself.'

554
00:50:44,463 --> 00:50:45,943
I know this face.

555
00:50:48,023 --> 00:50:49,263
I've seen him.

556
00:50:51,823 --> 00:50:52,943
Here.

557
00:50:55,143 --> 00:50:57,533
I was waiting... for the Kays.

558
00:50:57,583 --> 00:50:59,743
We were going to a press conference and...

559
00:51:00,903 --> 00:51:05,023
... he was walking down the corridor
on his own, straight towards me.

560
00:51:08,783 --> 00:51:10,183
How can that be?

561
00:51:56,583 --> 00:51:58,613
Spector was asked to account

562
00:51:58,663 --> 00:52:02,413
for his whereabouts on the
nights that the attacks took place

563
00:52:02,463 --> 00:52:06,573
but not on any other nights to
see whether his recall was as good.

564
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:09,773
He came in voluntarily. Why would
he do that if he's the killer?

565
00:52:09,823 --> 00:52:13,533
For the thrill? To parade
himself under our noses?

566
00:52:13,583 --> 00:52:15,453
To make us look stupid?

567
00:52:15,503 --> 00:52:18,853
To demonstrate his superiority
and utter contempt for us?

568
00:52:18,903 --> 00:52:20,383
Do I have to go on?

569
00:52:22,903 --> 00:52:25,143
Did you interview his wife?

570
00:52:26,743 --> 00:52:29,183
Did you check those
alibis face-to-face?

571
00:52:31,543 --> 00:52:33,143
No, ma'am. On the phone.

572
00:52:34,823 --> 00:52:38,693
He seemed like a good guy...
bright, likeable, helpful.

573
00:52:38,743 --> 00:52:41,613
He let us take his prints, his DNA.

574
00:52:41,663 --> 00:52:44,413
It didn't seem as though
he had anything to hide.

575
00:52:44,463 --> 00:52:47,213
A married man, a father of
two, a bereavement counsellor...

576
00:52:47,263 --> 00:52:48,653
Jesus, Glen.

577
00:52:48,703 --> 00:52:52,333
What have I been saying about
such individuals since day one?

578
00:52:52,383 --> 00:52:58,613
They frequently appear to be
charming, intelligent, charismatic.

579
00:52:58,663 --> 00:53:00,493
The key word is "appear".

580
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:04,213
They have to be probed,
wrong-footed, challenged.

581
00:53:04,263 --> 00:53:06,613
And why has nobody followed up

582
00:53:06,663 --> 00:53:10,103
- with the list of children's homes that he gave?!
- I need a word.

583
00:53:11,743 --> 00:53:13,303
In private.

584
00:54:10,023 --> 00:54:14,093
As SIO, you have to sign off
every action. You know that.

585
00:54:14,143 --> 00:54:17,573
Now, if you weren't happy, you
should have raised another action to

586
00:54:17,623 --> 00:54:19,663
have further inquiries made.

587
00:54:22,783 --> 00:54:24,703
Call Morning Prayers for 7am.

588
00:54:25,703 --> 00:54:27,703
I will need to brief the Chief at nine.

589
00:54:31,263 --> 00:54:36,253
Ma'am. Excuse me. There's been a
call on your old private number.

590
00:54:36,303 --> 00:54:37,893
It rang twice, then rang off.

591
00:54:37,943 --> 00:54:41,333
The call was made from
Rose Stagg's mobile phone.

592
00:55:10,183 --> 00:55:11,663
Well?

593
00:55:13,463 --> 00:55:14,893
It was amazing.

594
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:16,263
Tell me everything.

595
00:55:56,503 --> 00:55:58,303
It's Rose Stagg's number, ma'am.

596
00:56:02,143 --> 00:56:03,383
Gibson.

597
00:56:04,383 --> 00:56:05,623
'Stella?'

598
00:56:08,943 --> 00:56:10,223
Yes.

599
00:56:11,223 --> 00:56:13,343
'How nice to hear your voice again.'

600
00:56:15,783 --> 00:56:17,103
Is that you, Peter?

601
00:56:18,183 --> 00:56:19,343
Yes.

602
00:56:20,503 --> 00:56:21,983
'Why are you calling me?'

603
00:56:23,903 --> 00:56:25,783
Because I'm looking up at the sky.

604
00:56:27,103 --> 00:56:30,143
Stella, shining star.

605
00:56:32,383 --> 00:56:35,223
It's a beautiful night...
made me think of you.

606
00:56:38,783 --> 00:56:40,583
'What have you done with Rose?'

607
00:56:42,263 --> 00:56:43,653
Who?

608
00:56:43,703 --> 00:56:46,013
Rose Stagg.

609
00:56:46,063 --> 00:56:47,783
Rose McGill.

610
00:56:52,463 --> 00:56:56,903
You must want me to know that you have
her, or why would you be using her phone?

611
00:56:59,663 --> 00:57:03,623
You wrote that you feel
protective towards children.

612
00:57:05,823 --> 00:57:07,613
Rose has two.

613
00:57:07,663 --> 00:57:10,183
'A boy of 15 months and a girl of six.'

614
00:57:12,343 --> 00:57:15,503
'Her daughter particularly is missing her.'

615
00:57:20,063 --> 00:57:21,663
'What are you going to do?'

616
00:57:23,223 --> 00:57:26,853
Stella, I don't know what's
going to happen to me, to you,

617
00:57:26,903 --> 00:57:28,823
to anyone else in this world.

618
00:57:31,023 --> 00:57:32,613
All I know is,

619
00:57:32,663 --> 00:57:35,223
'no-one can outwit death.'

620
00:57:40,463 --> 00:57:41,623
Peter?

621
00:57:45,303 --> 00:57:46,503
Peter?
